Hi, this is Siddharth, I am a third year undergraduate student persuing a B.Tech degree in Computer Science Engineering with Artificial Intelligence at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri, Kerala but my native place is Hyderabad, Telangana. 

I spend most my time reading and learning about Machine Learning and Deep learning, build projects using them and put some content about the same in my blogs. You can checkout my blogs [here](/posts).

I spend my weekends participating in hackathons. I have participated in quite a few hackathons and won a few. The experice of taking part in a hackathon and brainstorming over an idea and building a project is a whole different feeling and I enjoy doing it.
