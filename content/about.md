Welcome to my personal website! I'm Sai Siddharth Cilamkoti, a passionate and dedicated Computer Science enthusiast with a profound interest in Software Development and Artificial Intelligence(Machine Learning and Deep Learning). Currently, I am persuing a Master's degree in Computer Science from [the University at Buffalo, SUNY](https://www.buffalo.edu/), extending my persuits in education after a Bachelor's of Technology in Computer Science Engineering with a focus on Artificial Intelligence from [Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham](https://www.amrita.edu/).

My journey in the world of technology has been shaped by diverse experiences and a relentless enthusiasm to learn. From my early days as a student, I've been driven by a fascination for the convergence of computer science and artificial intelligence. 

During my time as a Research Intern at [INAI, IIIT-Hyderabad](https://inai.iiit.ac.in/index.html), I delved into the realm of application of Computer Vision and Deep Learning in real world problems, contributing to projects that enhance road safety and automation. My contribution resulted in a significant boost in the accuracy and reliability of existing models in their road safety projects. This experience reinforced my belief in the transformative power of technology and its potential to shape a safer, smarter world.

I was also an active member and mentor at [amFOSS](https://amfoss.in/), the Free and Open Source Software club of my undergraduate college, allowed me to contribute to the open-source community and allowed me to collaborate on projects from people all round the world. I was also involved in organizing many events of the club and mentored my juniors in their journey of exploring technologies.

I was fortunate to be introduced to Hackathons through my mentors at amFOSS club. Participating in Hackathons was a different and a unique experience for me. I'm honoured that my work has received praise, including being named the winner of the Lights, Camera, Hacktion Hackathon and the best Hack in the Educational track at hello:world by the Cal Hacks team of UC Berkeley. My involvement in prestigious occasions like HackMIT, Junction, and Hack The North was one of a kind experience.

On this website, you'll find a showcase of my projects, and blogs that I plan to write about my experiences in technologies and life in general.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to [connecting](/contact) with you
